In java Converting the subclass type into super class type is called genaralized classess or genaralization
or upcasting.
In java Converting the super class type into sub class type is called specialized classess or specialization
or Downcasting.

a)when the classes or declared as final,this type of classes and its properties cannot be inherited.

b)string and Math classes,
	java.lang.String and java.lang.math

c)delegation

  collection.sort();
  stream.sorted();

* arrayList is slow comapring linked list.
  linked list is fast comapring arrayList.
  
* array list uses dynamic array to store the elements.
  LinkedList uses doubly linked list to store the elements.
  
* arraylist is a list but linked list act has a both list and queue.
   
* manipulation esy in linkedlist, storing and accessing the data esy in array list.
  
  
7.
*  iterator traverse only forward direction,ListIterator traverse both forward and backward direction.
*  iterator use for only traverse list and set etc but ListIterator traverse only for list.
*  methods in iterator next(),remove(),hasnext(), methods in Listiterator is next(),previous(),hasnext(),etc.
  
8.
covariant method
 it is overriding method,it hels to avoid the downcasting.

methodOverriding in java
 it is a feature that provieds method implementation to subclass that are alardy available in a parent class is called 
 method overriding.
 
9.
 when the garbage collector doesn't recognize the unused objects 
 and the objects are remaining in the memory it reduces the amount of memory allocation that memory is wasted this scenario is called
 memory leakage.
 
10.
 Method overloading is called static polymorphism,it is a creation of methods with the same name
 and different parameters. 
 method overriding is called dynamic polymorphism, it is a feature that provieds method implementation to subclass 
 that are alardy available in a parent class is called
